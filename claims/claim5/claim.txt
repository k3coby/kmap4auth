Claim 5: Table 6 consistency (Kmap1FA sufficiency)

The output of the following script is consistent with the results in Table 6
of the paper:

- Command: `python3 access_analyzer.py -s data_with_kmap.csv Kmap1FA`
  (after generating `data_with_kmap.csv` via `python3 kmap_simplify.py data.csv data_with_kmap.csv`)

This claim asserts that the counts produced by the command match the counts in
Table 6 per the mapping in `claims.txt`.
