Claim 3: Table 4 consistency (2FA — sufficiency and necessity)

The outputs of the following scripts are consistent with the results in Table 4
of the paper (Upper/Sufficiency and Lower/Necessity sub‑tables):

- `python3 access_analyzer.py -s data.csv 2FA`
- `python3 access_analyzer.py -n data.csv 2FA`

This claim asserts that the counts produced by the commands match the counts in
both Table 4 sub‑tables per the mapping in `claims.txt`.
