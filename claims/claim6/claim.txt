Claim 6: Table 7 consistency (1FA vs. Kmap1FA factor sets)

The output of the following script is consistent with the results in Table 7
of the paper:

- Command: `python3 factor_analyzer.py data_with_kmap.csv 1FA Kmap1FA`
  (after generating `data_with_kmap.csv` via `python3 kmap_simplify.py data.csv data_with_kmap.csv`)

This claim asserts that the percentages and counts produced by the command are
consistent with Table 7 per the mapping in `claims.txt`.
