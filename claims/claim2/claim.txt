Claim 2: Table 3 consistency (Reset1FA — sufficiency and necessity)

The outputs of the following scripts are consistent with the results in Table 3
of the paper (Upper/Sufficiency and Lower/Necessity sub‑tables):

- `python3 access_analyzer.py -s data.csv Reset1FA`
- `python3 access_analyzer.py -n data.csv Reset1FA`

This claim asserts that the counts produced by the commands match the counts in
both Table 3 sub‑tables per the mapping in `claims.txt`.
